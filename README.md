# PickGenerator

create your own lockpicks with many settings. (Beta)

You can configure the Handle with Text and drill-holes,
configure the Shaft as regular, dental and curved with many details
and choose many types of picks like diamond, (double)ball, Rake and half
them. 

For SVG export copy the HTML-Source "SVG"-Source and add 
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" to the top SVG-Element.

For the next Versions:
[ ] Make a "Save SVG" button
[ ] Load and Save Configurations
[ ] Open configuration with Hashtags
[ ] More Handles and Picks
