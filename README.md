# PickGenerator

create your own lockpicks with many settings. (Beta)  
Don't use this picks directly on a lock. it will not work!  
instead print with a (2D/3D)-printer and drill a saw blad down
to the pick shape.  

[Try the PickGenerator on JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/3qc9gt46/5/embedded/result/?username=Phreak87)


## Configurations settings:  
**Handle:**
- Text with size, color and position
- Drill holes

**Shaft:**
- All with size, top + bottom size and orientations
- curved with curve parameters
- dental with different parameters
- Double with different parameters

**Tip**
- Diamond / Half with size and rotation settings
- rake with different complex settings
- ball / double-ball / half with different settings.

**3D:**
- load the saved SVG-File to blender.
- Size the parts by factor 100 (Select Object, press key: S, Type 100 and Enter)
- Convert the Parts to Meshes (ALT+C)
- Edit as you like export as STL for printing.

For the next Versions:
