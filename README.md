# PickGenerator

create your own lockpicks with many settings. (Beta)  
Don't use this picks directly on a lock. it will not work!  
instead print with a (2D/3D)-printer and drill a saw blad down
to the pick shape.  

## Configurations settings:  
**Handle:**
- Text with Size and position
- Drill holes

**Shaft:**
- All with size, top + bottom size and orientations
- curved with curve parameters
- dental with different parameters

**Tip**
- Diamond / Half with size and rotation settings
- rake with different complex settings
- ball / double-ball / half with different settings.

**SVG export:** 
copy the HTML-Source "SVG"-Node and add 
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" to the top SVG-Element.

**3D:**
- load the SVG-File to blender.
- Size the parts by factor 100 (Select Object, press key: S, Type 100 and Enter)
- Convert the Parts to Meshes (ALT+C)
- Edit as you like export as STL for printing.

For the next Versions:  

[] Make a "Save SVG" button.  
[] Load and Save Configurations.  
[] Open configuration with Hashtags.  
[] More Handles and Picks.
